Train reservation system project is a web-based application developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. The system allows users to search for available trains, view schedules, book tickets, and manage reservations. PHP handles the server-side logic, processing user inputs and interacting with the MySQL database, which stores all the essential data like train details, user information, and booking records. HTML and CSS are used to create and style the user interface, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for those navigating the system. This project aims to simplify the process of reserving train tickets online.
